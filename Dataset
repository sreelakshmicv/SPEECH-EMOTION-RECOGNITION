I downloaded the dataset from kaggle and the name of the data set is Toronto emotional speech set(TESS). 
There are a set of 200 target words were spoken in the carrier phrase "Say the word _' by two actresses (aged 26 and 64 years) and recordings were made of the set portraying each of seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, and neutral). 
There are 2800 data points (audio files) in total.
The dataset is organized such that each of the two female actors and their emotions are contained within its own folder. 
And within that, all 200 target words audio files can be found.
The format of the audio file is a WAV format.
